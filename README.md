# ML Final Project

This repository contains my final project for the DX603.

The project explores the Zillow dataset to predict property values using various regression models. The process includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model fitting and evaluation
- Comparison of Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting

## Repository Structure

- `Milestone_01_Final.ipynb`: Initial data exploration and preprocessing
- `Milestone_02.ipynb`: Feature engineering and modeling
- `milestone_1_zillow.csv`: Cleaned dataset from Milestone 1
- `zillow_dataset.csv`: Zillow properties dataset

## Results

Gradient Boosting achieved the lowest RMSE among all models tested, outperforming Linear Regression and Random Forest.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shmorhunmsds/ml_final_project.git
